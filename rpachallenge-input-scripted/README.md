**Rpachallenge  input form examples**

rpachallenge-InputForms is the normal an correct way of doing it

But since everyone want's to be as fast as possible, we can speed things up by not setting every value one at the time, but setting all values per page, in one go, so we do that in rpachallenge-InputForms-scriptsSome

And since we are already are cheating, why not just scrip it all ? 
so that is what rpachallenge-InputForms-scriptsall does.

Se video presentation of that here
